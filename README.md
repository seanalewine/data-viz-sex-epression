# Data Visualization of Sex Expression Differences in Two Distinct Populations

This example code allows you to represent comparative data of two distinct populations on one graph using R-Studio

## Initial Setup
1. Install base R Language: https://archive.linux.duke.edu/cran/
2. Install R-Code: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download

## Using the Scripts
1. Export the script you plan to use from Github & your experiment data set as a `.csv` file
2. Open R Code
3. In the bottom left window select 'Terminal'
4. Run the following command `install.packages("tidyverse")`. It may take awhile.
5. File > Open File...
6. Select the script from your download location.
7. Ensure that you have modified the `read_csv()` function in the script to import your experiment data from the correct location.
